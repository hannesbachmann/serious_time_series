Data that seems to be important:

- datetime separated into (day of week, month, year, time, work day)
- holiday of not (mark sunday as holiday, [maybe also mark saturday as holiday?])
- anomalies (corona lockdowns, reduced public transport offer)
- temperature for each datapoint
- power values
- how many tram, buses where operating (at this day)
- Wagon-kilometres / Vehicle-kilometres
- dependencies between past values and current/next values (like yesterday/last week and today/tomorrow)
- split day into night [20:00-05:00],
  rush-hour traffic (morning) [05:00-11:00],
  afternoon [11:00-20:00]   -> maybe move the end time to ~23:00/~23:00 for the weekend
  -> might be sliding depending on day of year
  -> different behavior on work day and weekend/holiday

-- when is the daily max outside of [05:00-11:00] ?  -> only on holidays and weekends
-- how many hours (per day) is the power over a specified limit? -> correlation with sunlight per day?
-- remove trend and seasonality from power values (and from temperature values) [week and year]
-- correlation between static power values and static temperature values?
