	\section{Introduction}
	Given a sequence of power values and some other features, 
	
	it is the goal to estimate power values for the next days.
	\section{Steps}
	- analyse raw dataset to detect ouliers
	
	--> plot yearly, weekly, daily means
	
	--> compare every year with its following year
	
	- analyse series with respect to coorelations
	
	--> plot power values against:
	
	---> temperatures
	
	---> day of week
	
	---> month
	
	---> year
	
	---> holiday
	
	---> time of day
	
	---> anomalies (corona lockdowns, reduced public transport offer)
	
	---> how many trams, buses where operating (at this day)
			represented as Wagon-kilometres / Vehicle-kilometres
