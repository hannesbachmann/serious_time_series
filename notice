Data that seems to be important:

- datetime separated into (day of week, month, year, time)
- holiday of not (mark sunday as holiday, [maybe also mark saturday as holiday?])
- anomalies (corona lockdowns, reduced public transport offer)
- temperature for each datapoint
- power values
- how many tram, buses where operating (at this day)
